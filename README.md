HUST Workshop at Supercomputing

## Layout of this repo

Each section of the sites has it's own file in the `_posts` folder.
The date in the file name determines where that text appears on the site.
The year portion of the filename will determine if it appears on the main page.
The sections of the main page are posts within that year and appear in reverse-date order (oldest appear at the top).

The organization of the sections is:
- `20XX-01-01-intro.md`: Site intro.
- `20XX-01-02-program.md`: Workshop program.
- `20XX-01-05-dates.md`: Deadlines.
- `20XX-01-06-committes.md`: Names and institutions of the committee members.
- `20XX-01-07-slides.md`: Links to the presentation slides.
- `20XX-01-08-history.md`: Links to past websites.

Create or removed sections by changing  the files within the `_posts` directory.
